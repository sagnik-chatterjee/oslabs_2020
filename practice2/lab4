1.Each file is referenced by a inode number which is addressed by a filesystem-unique numerical value known as an inode number,
2. It is both an physical object located on the disk of a unix style fs and a conceptual entity represented by a data structure in the kernel.

3. stat structure :
1. st_dev :- id of device containing file (%lud)
2.  st_ino :-  inode number (%ld)
3.  st_mode :- permissions  ?
4.  st_nlink :- number of hard links (%lud)
5.  st_uid :- user id of owner (%d)
6.  st_gid :- group id of owner  (%d)
7.  st_rdev :- device id (if special file) (%lud)
8.  st_size :- total size in bytes (%ld)
9.  st_blksize :- blocksize for filefilesystem io (%ld)
10. st_blocks :- number of blocks allocated (%ld) 
11. st_atime :- last access time (%ld)
12. st_mtime :- last modification time (%ld )
13. st_ctime :- last status change time (%ld)
14. argv[1] :- filename 

4. The inode number of root directory is 2 

5. To check the file type : 
	1. S_IFBLK :- block device node 
	2. S_IFCHR :- Character device node 
	3. S_IDFIR :- dIRECTORY 
	4. S_IFIFO :- FIFO
	5 .S_IFLINK :- SYmbolic link 
	6. S_IFREG :- regualr file 
	7. S_IFSOCK :- socket

1. Pipes: 
	1. Pipes are unideirectional byte streams that connect the statndarad output from one process into the standartad input of another process.A pipe is created using the systemcall pipe which returns a pair of file descriptors.
	2 .
	 int fd[2];
	 int res = pipe(fd[0],fd[1]);

	 fd[0] is set up for reading 
	 fd[1] is se t up for writing 

	3. Working of pipe :
		1. FIrst a process creates a pipe and then forks to create a copy of itself.
		2. the parent process closes the read end of the pipe.
		3. the child process closes the write end of the pipe 
		4. fork systemcall creates a copy of the process that was executing.
		5. the process which executes the fork is called the parent process and the new process is created is called the child process.

2. Named Pipes :FIFO 
Pipes can share data between related process i.e process that have been started from a common ancestor process.

Named pipe is a special type of file that exists as a name in the file system but behaves like the unnamed pipe .

mkfifo fiflename is used to make a named pipes 

looking for pipe in 
ls -lF /tmp/my_fifo
